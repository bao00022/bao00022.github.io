            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am already middle-aged, but I made the bravest decision of my life. I quit my job and came to Canada, where the temperature was about -20<sup>o</sup>c, to study and become a student at Algonquin College. <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> places great emphasis on <em>learning practical skills</em>, which is exactly what I lack.</p>
            <p>I particularly appreciate a famous saying</p>
            <blockquote>You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.-<cite>C.S. Lewis</cite></blockquote>
            <p>Age should not stop us from learning. Although the interactive media design major is quite challenging for me, I still want to break through myself and continue to learn and try new fields and content. Maybe I will find a new hobby and even become an interactive media designer.</p>
